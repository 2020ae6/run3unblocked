        <h2>Run 3: A Popular Endless Runner Game</h2>
        <p>Run 3 is a popular endless runner game set in space. Sprint through the tunnel with the little gray alien and avoid the gaps in the floor. You can flip the tunnel around and run along the walls and ceiling as well.</p>

        <div class="game-instructions">
            <p><strong>Left arrow key:</strong> Move the character to the left</p>
            <p><strong>Right arrow key:</strong> Move the character to the right</p>
            <p><strong>Up arrow key:</strong> Jump</p>
            <p><strong>Down arrow key:</strong> Duck or slide (depending on the character)</p>
            <p>Additionally, some characters have special abilities that can be activated by pressing certain keys. For example, the Skater character can perform a flip by pressing the "Z" key, while the lizard character can wall jump by pressing the "X" key.</p>

        <h2>How to Play Run 3?</h2>
        <p>In this addicting skill game, you have to run through a tunnel with the little gray alien. The space tunnel is full of gaps and missing tiles, and if you fall through any of these, you'll have to start the level over. There's a huge number of levels to explore. How far will you get?</p>
        <p>The alien can jump to another wall to rotate the tunnel. Gravity and the camera angle will adjust to follow the alien as you jump. Along the way, you'll encounter lots of new obstacles that you'll have to overcome in creative ways.</p>

        <h2 id="modes">Main Modes of Run 3</h2>
        <h3>Explore Mode</h3>
        <p>In Explore Mode, you start in the Main Tunnel and work your way through a bunch of connected levels. Your job is to find and map all of them. Right now, there are 309 levels across 21 sets. Most of the game's story happens in this mode.</p>
        
        <h3>Infinite Mode</h3>
        <p>In Infinite Mode, you play through a random selection of 325 levels. The goal is to go as far as you can without failing, with your distance tracked and shown on the screen. Power Cells are scattered throughout, becoming more valuable the farther you go. There's also a leaderboard to track the top distances.</p>

        <h2>Run 3 Shop</h2>
        <p>In the Shop, you can use Power Cells to buy characters, costumes, upgrades for Infinite Mode, a cutscene, and the Level Editor. Each item comes with a short description. For more details, check out the Shop's dedicated page.</p>

        <h2 id="tips">Tips and Tricks for Run 3</h2>
        <div class="tips">
            <p><strong>Big jumps, small jumps:</strong> You can adjust the length of your jumps. Some levels will feature big gaps while others might feature a rapid succession of small ones. To keep from falling through the cracks, tap and release the jump key quickly to make a small jump, or press and hold to make a bigger leap.</p>
            <p><strong>Think ahead:</strong> Try to keep looking ahead to see where to jump. If one route is not working for you, dare to be creative and try moving along a different one. Remember to keep an eye on the walls and ceiling as you run. You might spot a better route there.</p>
