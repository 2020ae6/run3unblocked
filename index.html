<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to play Run 3?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this addicting skill game, you have to run through a tunnel with the little gray alien. The space tunnel is full of gaps and missing tiles, and if you fall through any of these you’ll have to start the level over. There’s a huge number of levels to explore. How far will you get?<br><br>The alien can jump to another wall to rotate the tunnel. Gravity and the camera angle will adjust to follow the alien as you jump. Along the way, you’ll encounter lots of new obstacles that you’ll have to overcome in creative ways.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the Tips and Tricks for Run 3?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Big jumps, small jumps</em>&nbsp;– You can adjust the length of your jumps. Some levels will feature big gaps while others might feature a rapid succession of small ones. To keep from falling through the cracks, tap and release the jump key quickly to make a small jump, or press and hold to make a bigger leap.<br><br><em>Think ahead</em>&nbsp;– Try to keep looking ahead to see where to jump. If one route is not working for you, dare to be creative and try moving along a different one. Remember to keep an eye on the walls and ceiling as you run. You might spot a better route there.</p>
